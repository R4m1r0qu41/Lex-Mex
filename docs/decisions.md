## 2026-06-27 — PDF extraction boundary

The LRITF operational source is a text-based PDF. `lex-parse` invokes
`pdftotext -layout -nopgbrk` for extraction, records the extractor version, and
then performs all canonical normalization in Rust. This keeps the source
adapter reproducible without adding an immature PDF parser to the canonical
core.

## 2026-06-27 — Article-level first slice

The first parser emits ordinary articles and the statute's own transitory
provisions. It deliberately excludes appended full reform-decree transitories
from the statute provision list. Those require amendment-event modeling and
must not be conflated with the statute's own transitories.

## 2026-06-27 — No hidden LLM call

Temporal analysis produces a versioned, schema-bound request artifact. Model
execution and response import are explicit boundaries so deterministic runs do
not depend on credentials or silently change canonical data.

## 2026-06-28 — External Obsidian vault boundary

The Obsidian vault is not nested inside canonical corpus storage. The CLI
publishes to an explicit vault root supplied with `--obsidian-vault` or
`LEX_MEX_OBSIDIAN_VAULT`, and the exporter owns only
`Corpus/<instrument-short-name>/` below that root. Human-authored `Notas/`,
`Revisiones/`, attachments, and `.obsidian/` settings remain outside the
exporter's write boundary.
